* Raytracker â€” visualize when things start and end

This is a piece of software where you can visualize when things in your life start and end (or get abandoned). Currently supported categories are:

- Books
- People (e.g. friendships, acquaintances, romances)
- TV Shows
- Video Games
- Other

You can add:

- A title for the item
- Notes
- Start date
- End date
- If the item was completed or abandoned (think of a book that was too boring to continue reading)
